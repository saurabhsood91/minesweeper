## Minesweeper

An implementation of Minesweeper in React+Redux. Learning attempt for Redux, and React-Redux bindings. Tried as far as possible to stick to the Flux pattern.


### Stuff I focused on

- Thin Components, which just render and fire actions
- Most of the logic in the reducers
- Using ES6 features where possible
- Tried to use the Flux pattern as much as possible.
